   - Reorganized the panels from a vertical stack to a more horizontal arrangement
   - Created a two-row layout with panels distributed more evenly
   - Added appropriate Bootstrap classes for responsive behavior
   - Centered the entire layout with margins on the left and right sides

2. Updated App.css:
   - Adjusted panel heights and spacing
   - Modified the content wrapper to remove height limitations
   - Added new CSS classes for the horizontal layout
   - Updated responsive breakpoints for different screen sizes
   - Improved panel body styling with flex properties
   - Added centered-container class with left and right padding
   - Fixed sticky footer styling to match the centered layout
   - Added contrasting background color to html element to make centered content stand out
   - Modified body and #root elements to ensure content remains centered even in maximized browser windows

## Next steps
1. Consider further refinements to the layout based on user feedback
2. Potentially add more responsive optimizations for different screen sizes
3. Explore additional UI improvements such as:
   - Collapsible panels for even more space efficiency
   - Tabbed interfaces for certain sections
