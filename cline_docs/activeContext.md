# Active Context

## What you're working on now
Fixed the Azure Function App deployment issue where "No HTTP triggers found" error was occurring. The issue was related to the folder structure of the Azure Functions project, which had functions nested in `api/src/functions/` instead of being directly under the project root (`api/`).

## Recent changes
1. Restructured the Azure Functions project:
   - Moved function folders from `api/src/functions/` to directly under `api/`
   - Created proper function folders at the root level:
     - `api/GetSasToken/`
     - `api/ProcessImage/`
   - Removed the nested `src` directory
   - Ensured each function folder contains:
     - `function.json` with correct HTTP trigger bindings
     - `index.js` with proper module.exports format
   - Verified `host.json` has the correct version (2.0)
   - Confirmed `package.json` doesn't have isolated worker dependencies

2. Previous UI work (completed earlier):
   - Modified the layout structure in App.jsx:
     - Reorganized the panels from a vertical stack to a more horizontal arrangement
     - Created a two-row layout with panels distributed more evenly
     - Added appropriate Bootstrap classes for responsive behavior
     - Centered the entire layout with margins on the left and right sides
   - Updated App.css:
     - Adjusted panel heights and spacing
     - Modified the content wrapper to remove height limitations
     - Added new CSS classes for the horizontal layout
     - Updated responsive breakpoints for different screen sizes

## Next steps
1. Deploy the fixed Azure Functions to Azure:
   - Right-click on the project root (api folder)
   - Select "Deploy to Function App"
   - Choose subscription and Function App
   - Verify functions appear in Azure Portal

2. Connect the frontend to the deployed Azure Functions:
   - Update the BlobService.js to use the actual Azure Function endpoints
   - Test the image upload and processing functionality
   - Implement error handling for API calls

3. Further backend development:
   - Implement additional error handling in the Azure Functions
   - Add logging for better troubleshooting
   - Consider adding authentication to the API endpoints
