# Active Context

## What you're working on now
Architecture review and documentation of the LogoCraftWeb project. Analyzing the codebase to understand the system architecture, component structure, and data flow patterns.

## Recent changes
1. Updated systemPatterns.md with comprehensive architectural documentation:
   - Expanded component structure details with specific responsibilities
   - Added key state management information
   - Documented API communication patterns
   - Added detailed image processing information
   - Expanded architecture patterns with additional patterns identified:
     - Batch Processing
     - Progressive Enhancement
     - Client-Side Routing
     - Proxy Configuration

2. Previous Azure Functions restructuring (completed earlier):
   - Moved function folders from `api/src/functions/` to directly under `api/`
   - Created proper function folders at the root level:
     - `api/GetSasToken/`
     - `api/ProcessImage/`
   - Removed the nested `src` directory
   - Ensured each function folder contains:
     - `function.json` with correct HTTP trigger bindings
     - `index.js` with proper module.exports format
   - Verified `host.json` has the correct version (2.0)
   - Confirmed `package.json` doesn't have isolated worker dependencies

3. Previous UI work (completed earlier):
   - Modified the layout structure in App.jsx:
     - Reorganized the panels from a vertical stack to a more horizontal arrangement
     - Created a two-row layout with panels distributed more evenly
     - Added appropriate Bootstrap classes for responsive behavior
     - Centered the entire layout with margins on the left and right sides
   - Updated App.css:
     - Adjusted panel heights and spacing
     - Modified the content wrapper to remove height limitations
     - Added new CSS classes for the horizontal layout
     - Updated responsive breakpoints for different screen sizes

## Next steps
1. Validate architectural understanding and plan any necessary refinements:
   - Review the updated systemPatterns.md for accuracy and completeness
   - Identify any architectural improvements that could be made
   - Consider documenting any potential technical debt or areas for improvement

2. Deploy the fixed Azure Functions to Azure:
   - Right-click on the project root (api folder)
   - Select "Deploy to Function App"
   - Choose subscription and Function App
   - Verify functions appear in Azure Portal

3. Connect the frontend to the deployed Azure Functions:
   - Update the BlobService.js to use the actual Azure Function endpoints
   - Test the image upload and processing functionality
   - Implement error handling for API calls

4. Further backend development:
   - Implement additional error handling in the Azure Functions
   - Add logging for better troubleshooting
   - Consider adding authentication to the API endpoints
