# Progress

## What works
1. **Core Functionality**:
   - Image upload via drag-and-drop or file browser
   - Preview of uploaded images with size information
   - Selection of output formats
   - Simulated processing with progress indication
   - Results display with thumbnails and download options

2. **UI Components**:
   - Step indicator showing the current workflow stage
   - Image preview with file information
   - Format selection checkboxes with tooltips
   - Processing button with progress bar
   - Results gallery with thumbnails
   - Status bar showing current application state
   - Responsive layout for different screen sizes
   - Horizontal panel arrangement for efficient space usage

3. **Visual Design**:
   - Responsive layout that works on different screen sizes
   - Consistent styling with Bootstrap and custom CSS
   - Clear visual hierarchy with panels and sections
   - Horizontal layout that makes efficient use of screen space
   - CSS variables for consistent theming
   - Active/inactive panel states based on current step

4. **Backend Structure**:
   - Azure Functions project structure correctly set up
   - GetSasToken function for secure blob storage access
   - ProcessImage function for image transformation
   - Proper HTTP trigger bindings configured
   - Dependencies installed (Sharp, Azure Storage SDK)
   - Error handling with detailed error messages

5. **Documentation**:
   - Comprehensive architecture documentation in systemPatterns.md
   - Technical context documented in techContext.md
   - Product context documented in productContext.md
   - Active development context in activeContext.md
   - Progress tracking in progress.md

## What's left to build
1. **Backend Deployment**:
   - Deploy Azure Functions to Azure
   - Configure Azure Blob Storage containers
   - Set up environment variables and application settings
   - Test deployed functions with API tools

2. **Frontend-Backend Integration**:
   - Update BlobService.js to use actual Azure Function endpoints
   - Implement proper error handling for API calls
   - Add authentication and authorization if needed
   - Test end-to-end functionality

3. **Enhanced Features**:
   - Actual download functionality for processed images
   - Zip file creation for batch downloads
   - Custom output directory selection
   - Additional image processing options (quality, background, etc.)

4. **UI Improvements**:
   - Better mobile experience
   - Dark mode support
   - Accessibility improvements
   - Collapsible panels and more advanced UI interactions

5. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Add authentication for API endpoints
   - Secure storage access
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Rate limiting for API requests

## Progress status
- **Frontend UI**: 95% complete (layout improvements implemented)
- **Frontend Logic**: 70% complete (simulation only)
- **Backend API Structure**: 100% complete (folder structure fixed)
- **Backend API Implementation**: 80% complete (code exists but not deployed)
- **Backend API Deployment**: 0% complete (not yet deployed to Azure)
- **Image Processing**: 80% complete (code exists but not tested with real storage)
- **Deployment**: 0% complete
- **Documentation**: 90% complete (architecture and technical context documented)

Current focus: Completed architecture review and documentation update. The next step is to deploy the Azure Functions to Azure and connect the frontend to the deployed endpoints.
