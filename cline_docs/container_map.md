# Container Map - LogoCraftWeb

This diagram shows the main logical containers within the LogoCraftWeb application boundary, their interactions, and connections to users and external systems. It provides a more detailed view than the System Context Map.

**Legend:**

*   **Colors:**
    *   ðŸŸ© Green (`#90ee90`): Existing / Fully Functional
    *   ðŸŸ¨ Yellow (`#ffff99`): In Progress / Partially Built
    *   ðŸŸ¦ Blue: Planned / Not Yet Started (None in this diagram)
*   **Lines:**
    *   â”€â”€â”€ Solid (`#333`): Existing / Implemented Connection / Interaction
    *   â€‘â€‘â€‘ Dashed Yellow (`#ffcc00`): Partially Implemented / Needs Integration / Not Fully Tested End-to-End
*   **Labels:** Status indicated in parentheses within the node text.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Frontend SPA (In Progress):** The React UI is largely built but relies on simulated logic and API proxying (`server.js`). It needs to be integrated with the deployed backend and hosted in the Azure Web App defined in Bicep.
2.  **Backend API (In Progress):** The Azure Functions (`GetSasToken`, `ProcessImage`) are implemented using Managed Identity but are not yet deployed or fully integrated with the frontend.
3.  **Azure Blob Storage (Existing):** The external storage service is assumed to be available.
4.  **User's Browser/OS (Existing):** Essential for the frontend interaction.
5.  **End User (Existing):** Interacts with the application.
6.  **Interactions:**
    *   User <-> Frontend: Existing (UI interaction).
    *   Frontend <-> Browser: Existing (File handling).
    *   Frontend -> Blob (SAS Upload): Existing (Logic implemented in `BlobService.js`).
    *   Backend -> Blob (Managed Identity): Existing (Code implemented in Functions).
    *   Frontend -> Backend API: Partially Implemented/Needs Integration (Currently uses proxy, needs update to deployed Function App URL).
