**Legend:**

*   **Colors:**
    *   ðŸŸ© Green (`#90ee90`): Existing / Fully Functional
    *   ðŸŸ¨ Yellow (`#ffff99`): In Progress / Partially Built
    *   ðŸŸ¦ Blue: Planned / Not Yet Started (None in this diagram)
*   **Lines:**
    *   â”€â”€â”€ Solid: Existing Connection / Interaction
    *   â€‘â€‘â€‘ Dashed: Planned Connection / Interaction (None in this diagram)
*   **Labels:** Status indicated in parentheses within the node text.

**Explanation:**

1.  **LogoCraftWeb (In Progress):** The core application exists and has significant functionality (UI, API structure, Managed Identity), but integration and deployment are still pending (`progress.md`).
2.  **End User (Existing):** The primary user interacts with the existing frontend UI.
3.  **Azure Blob Storage (Existing):** This is a core external dependency, and the integration via Azure Functions (`GetSasToken`, `ProcessImage`) is implemented.
4.  **User's Browser/OS (Existing):** This is an implicit external system required for file uploads and downloads, which is fundamental to the existing workflow.
5.  **Connections (Solid):** All depicted interactions (UI interaction, file handling, blob storage access) are part of the current, implemented functionality, even if the end-to-end flow isn't fully deployed.
