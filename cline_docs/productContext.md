# Product Context: LogoCraftWeb

## Why this project exists
LogoCraftWeb is a web application designed to help users convert and process logo images into multiple formats with ease. It provides a user-friendly interface for uploading images and converting them to various standard logo formats required for different applications.

## What problems it solves
- Simplifies the process of converting logos to multiple required formats
- Eliminates the need for users to manually resize and convert images using complex image editing software
- Ensures logos meet the specific dimension requirements for different platforms and applications
- Provides a streamlined workflow for logo processing with clear steps
- Offers batch processing capabilities to generate multiple formats at once

## How it should work
1. **Upload**: Users upload an original logo image through a drag-and-drop interface or file browser
2. **Configure**: Users select which output formats they want to generate from a predefined list of common logo formats
3. **Process**: The application processes the image, converting it to the selected formats while maintaining proper dimensions and quality
4. **Results**: Users can preview all generated formats and download them individually or as a batch

The application follows a three-step workflow (Upload → Configure → Results) with a clear visual indicator of the current step. The interface is designed to be intuitive with a control panel on the left side and a preview/results area on the right side.
